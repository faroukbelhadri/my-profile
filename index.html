			<h3> Here is a snippet of my work experiences: </h3>
				<p class="pmi-text"> I have mainly taken entrepreuarial initiatives. During my previous role at Philip Morris International as an IS-Digital intern, I supported the b2b solutions and analytics, sales and marketing teams through the cross-functional projects with recurring insight reports and ad hoc data analysis. I pioneered the development and implementation of a cloud-based IT Assets management system where a built-in online database serves as the data repository and a Microsoft PowerApps as the UX interface (GUI) accessible through any digital outlet (smart phone, tablet, desktop). Besides, I developed two dashboards on Tableau and PowerBI in order to have a regular follow up (thanks to daily extracts) on the asset allocation. This initiative helped transform the interactions between the business stakeholders and the inventory management systems into an automated service and was implemented to help more than five hundred sales representatives on the field, plus gathering data and sharing information all around Switzerland
